# What is Iic Tac Toe game?

# A board game with two players. We start with an empty 3x3 board. One player is 'X', 
#the other player is 'O'. The 'X' player goes first. Then players alternate to mark empty  
#squares. Alternate turns until a players gets 3 squares in a row. If all squares are marked
#and nobody win, then it's a tie.
